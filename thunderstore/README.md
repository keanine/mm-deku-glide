# Deku Glide
This mod gives Deku Link the option to glide after jumping from a ledge. Press A in midair and he'll float forward using the same mechanic as Deku Flowers.

Itâ€™s a small change that goes a long way into making Deku Link feel more useful, giving players more reason to stay in Deku form.
